# R can do sums ...

# Exercises
#

# What does: 11 + 1 / 6  evaluate to ?
11 + 1 / 6

# Solution:
11.16667

# Calculate 10 plus 2 all divided by 3 and then squared
((10 + 2) /3)^2

# Solution:
1.333333

# Storing values
a <- 3              # assign the number 3 to OBJECT (variable) called "a"
b <- 5              # assign 5 to b

a                   # so what's the value of OBJECT "a"
b                   # ... and what's b

a + b               # we can add them together just like numbers

# --------
# Exercise
# --------
#
# What happens if we change a and then re-add a and b? [Hint: Try it now]
#
# Does it work if you just change a in the script and then add a and b? [Hint: Try it]
#
# Did you still get the same answer after you changed a? 
# If so, why do you think that might be?
#
# We can also assign the result of a + b to a new variable, c. 
# How would you do this?

a <- 100

# Solution:

# == != < > >= <= !     ! = opposite of

# Topic: Displaying results

weight_lb <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_lb <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis () around and expression makes it display

#
# Topic: Comments
#

# Comments (like this one) are usually helpful

     # they can also be indented

# They should be supportive (not redundant e.g. "this is a comment")

# 
# Exercise
# 
#
# Add explanatory comments to the following lines of code
#

ft <- 3                 # feet
in <- ft * 12           # convert feet to inches
cms <- in * 2.54        # convert inches to centimeters (using conversion factor 2.54)
m = cms / 100           # convert centimeters to meters

#but you shoul do this

feet <- 3                   # 
inches <- ft * 12           # because there a 12 inches in a foot
centimeters <- in * 2.54    # because there are 2.54 cms in and inch)
meters = cms / 100          # becase there are 100 cms in a meter


# Topic: Functions and Arguments
#
# Square Root:  sqrt()
#
sqrt(2)

# arguments can be constants of objecs
sqrt(age)

# Absolute Value: abs()

# 
# Decimal rounding: round(3.14159)
round(3.14159)

# Built-in constants: eg, pi

# Getting help about particular functions 
#
# Question Mark followed by function name, eg: ?round
?round

round(pi, digits = 5)
round(1023.321, digit = -2)

# or if we just want to know round the arguments, use: args()
args(round)  #tells you what you need to put in the function

# Argument have default order - but can re-ordered using names
#
# round(3.14159, 2)
# round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)
round(3.14159, 2)
round(digits = 3, x = pi)

#
# Exercise
#
# what does the function called log10() do ?  Can you test it ?
# log tell you how many zero's there are in a number
#
# Answer:
?log10
log10(1000)


#
# Topic: Vectors and Data Types

# Combine some values in a 'vector'
#
# c(value, value, value ...)
#
# Let's assign the following numbers to an object called glengths:
#
#  4.6, 3000, 50000
glengths <- c(4.6, 3000, 50000)

# and repeat to create a vector of species
#
#  "ecoli", "human", "corn"
species <- c("ecoli", "human", "corn")

# use length() to obtain how many elements a vector contains
length(species)

# we can also ask what structure of our vectors look like with str()
str(species)

# and also see what class they are with class()
class(species)
class(glengths)

# and btw, there are other classes as well ...
#
# sqrt_of_minus_one <- sqrt(-1+0i)
# true_or_false_value <- TRUE
# decimal_number = 54.0
# whole_number = -54L

#
# Once we have some vectors, we can apply operations to them as a whole
#

# multiply glengths by 5
# add glength to itsself
glengths * glengths
glengths * 5


# appending and prepending elememts to a vector
#
# c(vector, value)
# c(value, vector)
#
c(-500, glengths, glengths, 1000)


# note all the elements of a vector must be the same type
length_species <- c(4.5, "ecoli")
length_species

# This automatic conversion is called 'coercion' or 'casting' ..

# --------
# Exercise
# --------
#
# We’ve seen that vectors can be of type character, 
# numeric (or double), integer, and logical. 
#
# But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?
#
# eg:
#
#   thing <- c("some characters", 3.141, 100, TRUE)
#   thing
#   class(thing)
#


# What will happen in each of these examples?
#
#   num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
#   num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
#   char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
#   tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
#
# [Hint: use class() to check the data type of your objects]
#
# Can you explain why you think it happens?

# --------
# Exercise
# --------
# How many values in combined_logical are "TRUE" (ie character 4 characters)
# in the following example:
#   
#   num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
#   char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
#   combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)


#
# Topic: Subsetting vectors
#

# create a vector
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")

# reference (access) the second element using [] 
animals[4]

# access the subset consisting of element 3 and element 2
animals[c(1,4)]

# we can reference each element more than once
#
# six animal names referenced by indexes 1,2,3,3,2,1


# Conditional subsetting
#
# weight_g <- c(21,   34,    39,   54,   55)
# weight_g[   c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]
# 
weight_g <- c(21,   34,    39,   54,   55)
weight_g[   c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]

# using comparison operators to generate a 'logical' vector 
#
# vector of which weight are greater then 50
weight_g[weight_g >50]



# ... and the use this to subset the data vector

# and we can get more fancy with comparisons 
#
#  weight_g < 30 | weight_g > 50
#  weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21

# another example with animals
#
# animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
# animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"


# %in% operator 
#
# animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")
# animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")]

# Challenge
#
# Can you explain  why 
#
#  "four" > "five" 
#
# returns TRUE?
#
# Answer:


# Topic: Missing data (NA - Not Available)

# heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
#
# lets look at the mean(), max() with and withoout na.rm = TRUE

# other ways to exclude NAs - is.na(),  na.omit(), copmlete.cases()



#
# Exercise (extended)
#
#
# Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector 
# with the NAs removed.
# 
#   heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
#
# Solution


# Use the function median() to calculate the median of the heights vector.
#
# Solution


# Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.
#


# [Hint: R has a builtin function called length() that tells you 
# how many values are in a vector
